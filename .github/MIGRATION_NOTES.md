# CI Migration Notes

## Old Workflow Files Detected

The following legacy workflow files from the original template were found:

- `macos.yml`
- `ubuntu.yml`
- `windows.yml`
- `release.yml`

## New Consolidated Workflow

The new CI setup consolidates all platform builds into unified workflows:

### `ci.yml` replaces:
- `ubuntu.yml` - Ubuntu GCC build
- `macos.yml` - macOS build  
- `windows.yml` - Windows MSVC build

**Advantages of new approach:**
- ✅ Single workflow file with matrix strategy
- ✅ More platforms (Ubuntu GCC + Clang)
- ✅ Modern GitHub Actions (v4)
- ✅ Additional checks (static analysis, sanitizers, formatting)
- ✅ Triggers on multiple branches (main, master, develop)
- ✅ Automatic GoogleTest fetching via CMake
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage with dedicated jobs

### `quick-check.yml` adds:
- Fast PR feedback (2-3 minutes)
- Essential build and test checks only

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Keep Both (Recommended for Transition)

Keep old workflows temporarily while verifying new ones work:

**Pros:**
- Gradual migration
- Fallback if issues arise
- Can compare results

**Cons:**
- Redundant CI runs
- Increased CI time/costs
- Potential confusion

### Option 2: Remove Old Workflows (Clean Start)

Delete old workflow files after verifying new CI works:

```bash
cd .github/workflows/
rm macos.yml ubuntu.yml windows.yml release.yml
```

**Pros:**
- Clean, single source of truth
- Faster CI (no duplicate runs)
- Easier maintenance

**Cons:**
- Must be confident new CI works
- No fallback

### Option 3: Rename Old Workflows (Archive)

Rename old workflows to prevent them from running:

```bash
cd .github/workflows/
mv macos.yml macos.yml.old
mv ubuntu.yml ubuntu.yml.old
mv windows.yml windows.yml.old
mv release.yml release.yml.old
```

**Pros:**
- Keep as reference
- Easy to restore if needed
- Won't run automatically

**Cons:**
- Clutters directory

## Key Differences

### Old Workflows (ubuntu.yml, etc.)

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2  # Older version
- Triggers only on: master
- Manual GoogleTest installation
- Separate file per platform
- Basic build and test only
```

### New Workflows (ci.yml)

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Latest version
- Triggers on: main, master, develop
- Automatic dependency fetching
- Matrix strategy for all platforms
- Additional jobs:
  - Static analysis (Clang-Tidy)
  - Code coverage
  - Formatting checks
  - Address sanitizer
```

## Release Workflow

The old `release.yml` handles GitHub releases. Review it separately:

- If you use automated releases, update it to match new CI
- If not needed, remove it
- Consider integrating with new CI workflow

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Push new workflows to GitHub
- [ ] Verify new CI runs successfully
- [ ] Check all jobs pass (green checkmarks)
- [ ] Verify coverage reports to Codecov
- [ ] Review static analysis findings
- [ ] Update README badges (already done ✅)
- [ ] Decide on handling old workflows:
  - [ ] Option 1: Keep temporarily
  - [ ] Option 2: Delete old workflows
  - [ ] Option 3: Archive old workflows
- [ ] Update branch protection rules to use new workflows
- [ ] Notify team of CI changes

## Testing New Workflows

### 1. Create a test branch:
```bash
git checkout -b test-new-ci
git push origin test-new-ci
```

### 2. Open a PR to trigger workflows:
- Quick Check should run automatically
- Verify all jobs pass

### 3. Merge to main/master:
- Full CI workflow should run
- All platforms should build successfully

### 4. Monitor first few runs:
- Check for any failures
- Review timing (should be 5-10 minutes total)
- Verify coverage uploads

## Troubleshooting

### If New CI Fails:

1. **Check logs** in GitHub Actions tab
2. **Compare** with old workflow behavior
3. **Keep old workflows** until issues resolved
4. **Review** workflow documentation

### If You Need Old Workflows:

You can always restore them from git history:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 .github/workflows/ubuntu.yml
git commit -m "Restore old Ubuntu workflow temporarily"
```

## Recommendation: Clean Migration

After verifying new CI works (1-2 successful runs):

```bash
# Remove old workflows
cd .github/workflows/
rm -f macos.yml ubuntu.yml windows.yml release.yml

# Commit changes
cd ../..
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "ci: remove legacy workflow files, now using ci.yml"
git push
```

This gives you a clean, modern CI setup focused on the new consolidated workflows.
